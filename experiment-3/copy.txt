>I usually wear S/M/L/XL in other brands. What size should I buy?
Simply buy the size you usually wear. Our garments are standard sizes, but if you have any problems with fit, returns in the UK are free and easy via Collect+ (outside of end of season sale period). 

> How do I make sure I buy the right size? 
To be absolutely certain, measure your chest and waist and use the chart above. 
Chest: Place the tape under your armpits and measure across the broadest part of your chest
Waist: Place the tape measure around your waist, just below your navel. 
Tip: Measure against your body, not over clothes. Hold the tape measure gently but firmly and do not pull it tight. If you're in between two sizes go for the larger size. 

>The last time I bought a Lyle & Scott garment it was too large/small. How do I avoid this?
We are sorry you have had problems in the past. In August 2013, we standardised Lyle & Scott sizes across all ranges. We now recommend buying your normal size.

>Is there a difference in size between the various ranges? 
No, not any more. Since August 2013, all Lyle & Scott ranges come in standardised sizes.  

>I’m still not sure. What should I do? 
The best thing to do is place your order and try it on at home. Returns in the UK are free via Collect+ (outside of end of season sale period), so it’s quick and easy to get a full refund if you are not satisfied with the fit.
